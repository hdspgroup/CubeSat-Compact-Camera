## Abstract

Monitoring and observation over the surface of the Earth have been a matter of global interest. In this path, recent efforts aim to develop a spatial mission to perform remote sensing applications. Mainly, CubeSats nanosatellites have emerged as a standard for developing low-weight and small-size instruments. In terms of payloads, state-of-the-art optical systems for Cubesats are expensive and designed to work in general use cases. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a 1.4U compact optical system to acquire spectral images from CubeSat standard satellite at the height of 550 km. To validate the proposed architecture, optical simulations using ray tracing simulation software are presented. Because the performance of computer vision tasks is highly related to the data quality, we compared the optical system in terms of the classification performance on a real remote sensing application. The performance of the optical characterization and the land cover classification show that the proposed optical system achieves a compact instrument, operating at a spectral range from 450 nm to 900 nm discretized on 35 spectral bands. The optical system has an overall F/# of 3.41 with a GSD of 52.8 m, and a Swath of 40 km. Additionally, the design parameters for each optical element are publicly available for validation, repeatability, and reproducibility of the results.
